# ReadTheDocs Configuration Fix Summary

## Issue
The ReadTheDocs configuration was failing with the error:
```
Config validation error in build.os. Value build not found.
```

## Root Cause
The `.readthedocs.yml` configuration file was missing the required `build` section and had incorrect structure.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated `.readthedocs.yml`
- **Added required `build` section** at the top level
- **Specified Ubuntu 22.04** as the build OS
- **Set Python 3.9** as the build tool
- **Cleaned up configuration** to remove unnecessary comments

**Before:**
```yaml
# Required
version: 2

# Build documentation in the docs/ directory with Sphinx
sphinx:
  configuration: docs/source/conf.py
```

**After:**
```yaml
# Required
version: 2

# Build configuration
build:
  os: ubuntu-22.04
  tools:
    python: "3.9"

# Build documentation in the docs/ directory with Sphinx
sphinx:
  configuration: docs/source/conf.py
```

### 2. Updated `docs/requirements.txt`
- **Changed from exact versions to minimum versions** for better compatibility
- **Added missing dependency** `sphinx-autodoc-typehints`

**Before:**
```
sphinx==7.2.6
sphinx-rtd-theme==2.0.0
myst-parser==3.0.0
numpy==2.0.2
matplotlib==3.9.0
```

**After:**
```
sphinx>=7.0.0
sphinx-rtd-theme>=2.0.0
myst-parser>=3.0.0
numpy>=1.20.0
matplotlib>=3.5.0
sphinx-autodoc-typehints>=1.25.0
```

### 3. Verified Configuration
- **Tested YAML syntax** - Configuration loads successfully
- **Tested Sphinx build** - Documentation builds locally
- **Verified structure** - All required sections present

## Key Changes

1. **Build Section**: Added required `build` section with OS and Python version
2. **Version Flexibility**: Changed to minimum version requirements
3. **Dependencies**: Added missing Sphinx extension
4. **Cleanup**: Removed unnecessary commented sections

## Testing Results

✅ **YAML Configuration**: Valid and loads successfully
✅ **Sphinx Build**: Documentation builds locally with warnings only
✅ **Structure**: All required sections present and correctly formatted

## Next Steps

1. **Commit changes** to repository
2. **Push to remote** to trigger ReadTheDocs build
3. **Monitor build** on ReadTheDocs dashboard
4. **Address warnings** if needed (mostly formatting issues)

## Notes

- The build succeeded locally with only warnings (duplicate object descriptions, formatting issues)
- Warnings are non-critical and don't prevent documentation from building
- Configuration now follows ReadTheDocs v2 specification
- Python 3.9 is specified for compatibility with current dependencies
